Hi there 👋
💫 About Me:

I have successfully completed my PG Diploma in Embedded System Design at CDAC Hyderabad. My expertise includes Embedded C Programming, Microcontroller Interfacing, IoT, RTOS, and Embedded AI. I am passionate about designing real-time embedded systems that merge hardware and software for smart automation.
🔭 Recent Work & Projects:

    🚗 Real-Time Vehicle Detection & Adaptive Headlight System: Developed an ESP32-based smart headlight system that adjusts brightness and beam direction based on real-time sensor data. Integrated ThingSpeak for cloud monitoring and Twilio for emergency alerts.
    🤖 Embedded IoT Systems: Working on ESP8266 & STM32-based IoT solutions for automation, cloud connectivity, and real-time control.
    ⚙️ RTOS & Multitasking: Exploring FreeRTOS for task scheduling, inter-task communication, and real-time synchronization in embedded systems.

👯 Looking to Collaborate On:

    Embedded AI applications and real-time industrial automation projects.
    Microcontroller-based device drivers & firmware development.
    IoT solutions leveraging ESP32, STM32, and cloud integration.

🌱 Currently Learning:

    Advanced Embedded Linux, Device Drivers, and Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).
    Optimizing firmware performance and low-power embedded design.
    Secure IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee) & Cloud Integration.

💬 Ask Me About:

    Embedded C, Microcontroller Programming, IoT, and Real-Time Systems.
    How to approach embedded system projects for practical applications.
    Optimizing sensor-based decision-making for real-time automation.

⚡ Fun Fact:

I'm passionate about building intelligent embedded solutions that improve automation, safety, and real-time decision-making. My ultimate goal is to start my own embedded systems company in the future! 🚀
